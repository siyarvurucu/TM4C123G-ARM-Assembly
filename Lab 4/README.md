# General Purpose Timer Modules

1. Pulse.s is a program to generate a square pulse train with 20 kHz frequency.  
But the code is not complete, write the missing parts. Write  
My Timer0A Handler ISR. Pick the duty cycle as 60%.  

2. Write a program which reads an input signal from an external pin and measures its pulse width,   
period and duty cycle. The measurements are to be printed out on Terminal.
The input is the same signal generated in Step 1.
